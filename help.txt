1. Navigation and Basic Commands.
Â Â  - Use theÂ Â  ".display"Â Â  command 
Â Â Â Â  to see the contents of the base 
Â Â Â Â  directory.
Â Â  - Navigate to a subdirectory using 
Â Â Â Â  the `.open_x` command, where `x` 
Â Â Â Â  is the number associated with the 
Â Â Â Â  subdirectory in the contents.
Â Â  - Use the `.back` command to move 
Â Â Â Â  to the parent directory.

2. File and Folder Operations
Â Â  - Use commands like ".delete_x" 
Â Â Â Â  to delete a file or folder (replace `x` 
Â Â Â Â  with the corresponding number).
Â Â  - Rename a file or folder using 
Â Â Â Â  the ".rename_x" command, 
Â Â Â Â  providing the new name when 
Â Â Â Â  prompted.Â Â  
Â Â  - Create a new folder using the 
Â Â Â Â  ".new" command.

3. View File Information:
Â Â  - Get information about a file or 
Â Â Â Â  folder using the ".info_x" command
Â Â Â Â  (replace `x` with the corresponding 
Â Â Â Â  number).

4. Search for Files or Folders: 
Â Â  - Use the ".search" command to 
Â Â Â Â  search for files or folders. 
Â Â Â Â  Enter the search term when 
Â Â Â Â  prompted, and the results will 
Â Â Â Â  be displayed.

5. Help and Exiting:
Â Â  - If you need assistance or a 
Â Â Â Â  reminder of available commands, 
Â Â Â Â  use the ".help" command. 
Â Â  - To exit, use the ".exit" command.

Important Notes:
- Be cautious with file deletion, 
Â  as it's permanent and cannot be 
Â  undone. Confirm your actions before
Â  proceeding.
- Some commands require you to provide 
Â  a number (e.g., ".delete_x"). Ensure 
Â  you enter the correct number 
Â  corresponding to the file or folder
Â  you want to operate on.
- Use the ".display" command frequently 
Â  to keep track of your current 
Â  location and available files/folders.
Â  
Additional Tips
- Backup important files before 
Â  performing operations that could 
Â  lead to data loss. 
- Experiment with the commands in a 
Â  safe environment before using them
Â  on critical files
